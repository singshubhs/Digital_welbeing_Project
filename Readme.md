## Overview

### The challenge

Track your time efficiently and improve your productivity with the Time Tracking Dashboard. Switch between daily, weekly, and monthly stats effortlessly.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

- Implementing interactive features such as toggling between daily, weekly, and monthly stats
- Designing a user-friendly interface with hover states for interactive elements
- Enhancing accessibility and usability for seamless navigation and interaction

```js
// Fetch and parse the JSON data
fetch("data.json")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    // Loop through the cards and update the data
    cards.forEach((card, index) => {
      const title = card.querySelector(".card-type");
      const current = card.querySelector(".current-hours");
      const previous = card.querySelector(".previous-hours");

      // Initial data display
      title.textContent = data[index].title;
      current.textContent = data[index].timeframes.weekly.current + "hrs";
      previous.textContent =
        "Last week - " + data[index].timeframes.weekly.previous + "hrs";

      // Link event listeners
      links.forEach((link) => {
        link.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
          e.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default link behavior

          const timeframe = link.getAttribute("data-timeframe");
          current.textContent =
            data[index].timeframes[timeframe].current + "hrs";
          const reducedName = timeframe.replace(/ly$/i, "");
          const goodName = reducedName.replace(/i/i, "y");

          previous.textContent =
            "Last " +
            goodName +
            " - " +
            data[index].timeframes[timeframe].previous +
            "hrs";
          links.forEach((link) => link.classList.remove("activated"));
          link.classList.add("activated");
        });
      });
    });
  })
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

### Continued development

- Adding additional features such as customizable time tracking categories and goal setting functionality
- Improving performance and optimization for smoother user experience
- Enhancing responsive design for consistent experience across devices

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
